      Dermal Filler for the Lower Face: A New Kid on the Block
    </p>
    <p>
      Lower face definition can be one of the key challenges in medical
      aesthetics. The issues surrounding the jawline and chin are multiple, and
      can include the ageing process, an unbalanced profile, and poor
      correspondence with desired features in line with masculinity or
      femininity. Masculine and feminine in this context are used in reference
      only to those features which are generally found in male and female faces
      respectively, from a developmental and hormonal perspective. In reality,
      there is a broad continuum of features, with most people of falling
      somewhere on the spectrum. How each person ultimately choses to identify
      and, from an aesthetic perspective, to enhance themselves, is a personal
      matter. It is important that aesthetic clinicians be ready to address
      patients’ concerns independent of their sex at birth or otherwise. A
      defined jawline and a favorable profile contribute significantly to the
      perception of beauty in both males and females. While there are obvious
      limitations to how a deficit can be addressed non-surgically, it is also
      important to ensure patients are aware of the options for treating this
      area of the face that is so fundamental to promoting self-confidence.
      First, it is important to establish what the patient hopes to achieve.
      Let’s look at examples of aesthetically masculine and feminine jawlines
      and discuss each in turn.
    </p>
    <p className="font-weight-bold m-0">Brad Pitt</p>
    <ul className="orange-dot-li">
      A timeless example of a masculine attractive face, Brad Pitt has made a
      career out of his looks, of which the broad, defined jaw within a square
      face is an integral part. Features that make this face appear masculine
      can be discussed in anatomical terms:
      <li>
        Broad chin which is less pointed than in a classically feminine chin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broad jaw with bulky muscles which add to the lateral projection – the
        important muscle in question is called Masseter, a powerful muscle of
        mastication (chewing).
      </li>
      <li>
        A lateral jaw projection which is in line with the cheek bones, creating
        a squared face which is classically masculine.
      </li>
      <li>A relatively longer lower facial third.</li>
    </ul>
    <div className="text-center mb-5">

    </div>

    <p className="font-weight-bold m-0">Angelina Jolie</p>
    <ul className="orange-dot-li">
      An archetypal example of feminine features which are aesthetically
      pleasing, Angeline Jolie has a face which is immediately recognisable for
      may important reasons:
      <li>
        A chin which ends in a point, lacking the breadth of a classically
        masculine chin.
      </li>
      <li>
        A defined jaw which, while prominent, is less pronounced than the cheek
        bones.
      </li>
      <li>
        A relatively shorter lower facial third, making all three segments of
        the face of a similar dimension.
      </li>
      <li>A global appearance of a heart shaped or oval face.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <p>
      Examples are a useful way to explain how anatomy may convey a certain
      perceived feature or characteristic, but the ultimate assessment of a face
      is highly subjective, and requires an experienced practitioner with
      knowledge of facial anatomy and development.
    </p>
    <p className="font-weight-bold m-0">Treatment Options</p>
    <p>
      Facial harmonization can be very successful when undertaken by
      knowledgeable clinicians using the right products. Achieving the desired
      jaw line may involve the use of Botox ® to the jaw region, as well as
      dermal filler such as Juverderm ® VOLUX to add volume and define, and
      Juverderm ® VOLITE to improve skin elasticity and hydration. Above all,
      tailoring the treatment to address the clinical situation is vital, and
      will involve detailed consultation with the patient, comprehensive facial
      assessment and agreed treatment objectives between clinician and patient.
