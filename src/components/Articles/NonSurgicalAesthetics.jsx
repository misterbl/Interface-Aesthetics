    <p className="font-weight-bold m-0">Non-Surgical Aesthetics in the UK</p>
    <p>
      Non-surgical aesthetics is a term which is used to encompass a wide range
      of cosmetic treatments not undertaken in a surgical setting, being
      minimally invasive. Commonly, procedures include anti-wrinkle injections
      with products such as Botox ® and dermal filler injections. Others include
      skin treatments such as chemical peels, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)
      injections (know as the ‘vampire facelift’) and intradermal use of
      hyaluronic acid to promote skin tightening. While this is a rapidly
      expanding field with exciting advances and constant innovation, the
      regulatory framework to accompany this emerging ‘specialty’ has lagged
      somewhat behind. Referred to as a ‘specialty’, from a healthcare
      professional’s perspective, there is no recognised specialty training
      pathway to becoming an aesthetic specialist. Many clinicians may become
      highly experienced and talented injectors, with reputations and cohorts of
      loyal patients to match. Nevertheless, there are some clear differences
      between the non-surgical aesthetics industry and other areas of
      healthcare.

      Who carries out non-surgical aesthetic treatments in the UK?

      aesthetic treatments. This was in response to the Keogh Report (2013). Sir
      Bruce Keogh was commissioned to look into this area in the context of
      growing concern about the lack of regulation and guidance for both
      injectors and patients. The recommendations that emerged from the years of
      consultation between 2013-2016 form the basis of best practice within the
      UK, and there are some important points summarised below:

    <p>
      It is clear that certain procedures can only be carried out by
      GMC-registered medical doctors (hair transplant surgery, permanent dermal
      filler). Other procedures such as the commonly carried out botulinum toxin
      and temporary dermal fillers can be carried out by practitioners who have
      attained a postgraduate level of training, and ‘subject to oversight of an
      independent prescriber’. The level of oversight will depend on individual
      cases and the judgement of the practitioner and overseer. As such, there
      is a degree of ambiguity and variation in skill levels is possible here.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is clear, is that it will be very difficult for non-healthcare
      professionals to reach the level stipulated by these guidelines.
      Nonetheless, there is no legislation governing who can carry out
      procedures and as such, these are best practice guidelines.

    <p className="font-weight-bold m-0">FAQs from the HEE recommendations</p>
    <ul className="orange-dot-li">
      Here is a summary of some points that are relevant to readers:
      <li>
        Who should inject botulinum toxin (Botox ®) and dermal filler?
        <p>
          {`    Individuals with a relevant healthcare degree follow by study to
                a post-graduate level (identified as Level 7)`}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Who can legally inject botulinum toxin (Botox ®) and dermal filler?
        <p>
          {`    Anybody – there is no legislation regarding this and as such it
                is not illegal to carry out these treatments without a relevant
                healthcare qualification.`}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What does this mean on a practical level?
        <p>{`    Healthcare professionals are bound by codes of conduct and professional regulatory bodies (GMC, GDC, NMC) – this ensures that standards set out by HEE and general professionalism principles are followed`}</p>
        <p>{`    Non-healthcare professionals who do not pertain to any regulatory body are not subject to this oversight and code of practice. Complaints or poor practice will not be covered by the regulatory bodies governing registered healthcare professionals.`}</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Who can prescribe Botulinum Toxin (eg: Botox ®)?{" "}
        <ul>
          <li>GMC-registered Doctors</li>
          <li>GDC-registered Dentists</li>
          <li>Independent Nurse prescribers</li>
          <li>Independent Pharmacist prescribers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Non-prescribers can inject botulinum toxin, provided they have had the
          product prescribed by a permitted prescriber, and, importantly, that
          the prescriber has carried out a face-to-face consultation with the
          patient.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Who can prescribe Dermal Filler?
        <p>{`    Dermal filler continues to be a ‘medical device’, and as such does not require a prescription.`}</p>
        <p>{`    There is discussion of reclassifying dermal filler at some point in the future; currently, it can be procured by non-prescribers.`}</p>
        <p>{`    There are serious issues regarding this, which will be discussed separately in a different blog.`}</p>

    </ul>
    <p className="font-weight-bold m-0">
      I am a healthcare professional. How can I get into aesthetics?
    </p>
    <p>A loaded question! </p>
    <ul className="orange-dot-li">
      First, let’s talk from the legal and professional perspective:
      <li>Legally, you are permitted to inject Botox® and dermal filler</li>
      <li>
        Professionally, you must adhere to the best practice guidance and code
        of conduct of your governing body (that is, with whom you are
        registered).{" "}
        <span className="font-weight-bold m-0">
          If you are not registered with a governing body, you should be.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul className="orange-dot-li">
      Next, from the indemnity perspective:
      <li>
        Ensure you have indemnity cover which specifically covers your aesthetic
        practice, in the setting in which you will be practising.{" "}
      </li>
      <li>
        You must also ensure the amount you earn via this practise is accounted
        for in your policy, as if you exceed a certain amount you may not be
        covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are unlikely to get indemnity at a reputable provider without
        attendance at an{" "}
        <span className="font-weight-bold m-0">
          accredited training course like the Interface Aesthetics Foundation
          Course.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul className="orange-dot-li">
      From the training perspective (what course is required)?
      <li>
        In order to get indemnity cover,{" "}
        <span className="font-weight-bold m-0">
          you must undertake an approved training course.
        </span>{" "}
        With this certificate you are then able to obtain indemnity and start
        practising.
      </li>
      <li>
        An approved Foundation Course is the first step in any practitioner’s
        journey into the area of non-surgical aesthetics. Choosing a course
        which provides sufficient hands-on practical experience using live model
        patients is of the utmost importance. In addition, look out for the
        accreditations and partners of the course you choose. For example, is
        the course CPD accredited, recognised by the leading indemnity providers
        and partnered with leading names within the industry.{" "}
        <span className="font-weight-bold m-0">
          Interface Aesthetics’ courses are CPD accredited, recognised by the
          two leading providers of cosmetic insurance in the UK, and partnered
          with Allergan ®; producers of Botox ® and Juvederm ® ranges.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      How do I progress within the industry, ensuring I acquire more skills?
      <li>
        A Foundation Course is the first step, but in order to progress you must
        both practise and attend further training.{" "}
      </li>
      <li>
        Practise should involve the techniques you have learnt and feel
        confident and competent to perform – this is why the choice of a
        Foundation Course with plenty of hands-on experience is so important.{" "}
        <span className="font-weight-bold m-0">
          The Interface Aesthetics Foundation Course in Botox ® and dermal
          filler takes place over two consecutive days, in small groups,
          ensuring delegates get the maximum hands-on injecting experience.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Attending further training may involve Advanced Courses, where
        techniques such as filler around the eyes and advanced Botox® injection
        techniques will be covered. Practitioners may opt for Masterclass
        courses which focus specifically on an area or technique. Ultimately,
        practitioners my wish to undertake a Level 7 qualification – this will
        be discussed in greater detail in a subsequent blog.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Whatever you reason for wanting to train in aesthetics, ensure that you
      take responsibility for the quality of your training by checking the
      credentials of your trainers and the format, practical content and
      accreditations of the course itself.{" "}
