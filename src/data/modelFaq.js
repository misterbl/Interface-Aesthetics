    title: "Who will carry out the treatments?",
    text:
      "All treatments are carried out by registered healthcare professionals (doctors, dentists and nurses). Unlike many courses Interface Aesthetics only trains registered healthcare professionals, and so you can have peace of mind regarding who will be treating you. In addition, all treatments are carried out under the direct expert supervision of one of our trainers, all of whom have backgrounds on facial surgery or aesthetics."

    title: "What treatments can I have done?",
    text:
      "The treatments available for a particular course depend on which techniques are being taught and on how many spaces have already been filled. The earlier you book on to one of our courses as model, the greater the chance that you will be able to have exactly the treatment(s) you want. On our Foundation course, for example, we require models for anti-wrinkle (Botox(R)) injections to the upper face and eyes, and for Dermal Filler for the lips, nasolabial lines, Marionette lines and cheek bones. If they wish models can have multiple treatments if there is availability."

    title: "What does the 70% discount on the usual price refer to?",
    text:
      "Model patients have the opportunity to have aesthetic treatments at a significant discount. Specific prices for each treatments can be found on this page, but in general all treatments will be at least 70% cheaper than the average clinic price. "

    title: "What happens on the day of the course?",
    text:
      "You will be treated as any private clinic patient. You will be greeted by one of our team, who will confirm some details and provide you with refreshments. You will then be seen by the doctor-trainer who will apply topical anaesthetic cream if indicated. Once it is time for the treatment, you will undergo a comprehensive aesthetic consultation and assessment. You will have the opportunity to ask questions, and there will be a consent form to sign. Our trainees will carry out the procedure under direct expert supervision by one of our trainees. Interface teaching is in small groups, so you will never have more than 4 trainees and one trainer in the room with you, ensuring you feel as comfortable as possible during the treatment."

    title: "What will happen afterwards?",
    text:
      "You will be given aftercare instructions verbally and in written format for you to take away. You will be given the contact details of the expert trainer who will follow up with you in two weeks if requested. You will be able to contact the team and the doctor at any time after the treatment, thus ensuring you feel confident and at ease at all times."
