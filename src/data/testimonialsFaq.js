        <p>
          We offer Foundation & Advanced courses in the use of Botox(R) and
          Dermal Filler.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Foundation Course is a starting point for healthcare professionals
          looking to start in non-surgical aesthetics. It is also necessary to
          have completed a recognised course in order to obtain cosmetic
          malpractice insurance - Interface Aesthetics' courses are fully
          accredited and recognised - providing delegates with a certificate
          with which they can obtain insurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Advanced Course is designed for practitioners who have already
          undertaken a Foundation Course, and are looking to learn a broader
          range of techniques which are beyond the scope of a Foundation Course.

      "Yes, as long as you have undertaken an approved course (for example, an approved Foundation Course), then you are able to undertake further training (eg: Advanced Course training) with us."

        <p>
          Delegates will learn how to carry out the most commonly requested
          procedures in non-surgical aesthetics using Botox(R) and dermal
          filler.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Botox(R) procedures involve the upper face, specifically the
          forehead, the brow and around the eyes ("crows feet"). The Botox(R)
          training takes place over one entire day, and involves 2 hours of
          lectures followed by a full day of injecting live model patients, This
          ensures delegates get the maximum hands-on experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dermal Filler procedures are lip augmentation, Marionette line
          filler, nasolabial filler and cheek bone augmentation. Again, the
          Dermal Filler training takes place over a full day, directly following
          the Botox(R) day, and consists in 2 hours of lectures followed by most
          of the day injecting patients.'

  {
    title: "Why should I choose an Interface Aesthetics course?",
    text:
      "Our courses put hands-on practical experience at the very heart of training. All teaching is delivered in small groups, with a maximum of 4 delegates per trainer, and all injecting is carried out on live model patients. This ensures our delegates can grow in both confidence and competence, and means the step on to becoming an independent practitioner will be a smoother one. In addition to the above, our courses are CPD accredited, recognised by the two leading insures for cosmetics in the UK, and partnered with the pharmaceutical company and industry leader, Allergan. Our training is designed and delivered by doctors with backgrounds in Maxillofacial Surgery & Aesthetics, ensuring detailed anatomical content which will make delegates safer and more confident practitioners."

    title: "What are the benefits of a career in non-surgical aesthetics?",
    text:
      "This is a rapidly expanding industry, with potential for continued growth over the coming years. Working either part-time as a supplement to a healthcare role, or starting out a new full-time career, there are significant opportunities in aesthetics. These include potential remuneration, greater autonomy, work flexibility, setting up and running your own business and professional fulfilment at having a positive impact on your patients and how they feel.
