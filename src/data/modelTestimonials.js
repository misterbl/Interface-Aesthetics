      "I had the pleasure of meeting James and the Interface team recently for Botox & fillers. I can honestly say after having had these treatments over the past ten years the treatment at Interface really was the absolute best! They made me feel very comfortable & were most professional. I am so happy with the results & will definitely be returning to the course for other treatments in the future. I highly recommend Interface Aesthetics. It was a 5 star experience for me.",

      "I had botox and filler treatments on the Interface Aesthetics course in April 2019. I was quite nervous about having the treatments at first, but it was also something I had always wanted to get done. I was surprised at how professional and focused the delegates were. I had a complete consultation, we discussed what I wanted to achieve and we came to an agreement on realistic and subtle changes that could be done. The time taken to talk everything through was amazing, and I really didn't expect such attention and care, given that it was a training course. I am extremely happy with the results that I have had and I look forward to going to the next course.",

      "The Interface team were incredibly friendly and helpful, I was given all the info I needed right from the start, and on the day I was made to feel at ease. The treatment was 10/10 and I was followed up weeks later to check everything was OK and that I was happy! I really didn't expect such great treatment as a model, I will definitely be going back.",

      "I have been a model for Interface Aesthetics several times now, and I can honestly say that it is a fantastic experience. Above all, the results are always outstanding, and the aftercare by the team is a real stand-out feature. I had had some aesthetic treatments before privately, but I cannot compare my previous experiences to Interface. From start  to finish, the team are friendly and caring, the delegates are extremely professional and the results, under the supervision of the surgeon trainers, are second to none. I have referred many friends to be models and they are all happy with their experiences and results. The fact that Interface is run by surgical doctors with such understanding of anatomy and such experience, means you are at ease and confident that you are going to receive excellent care. I fully recommend Interface Aesthetics!",

      "I attended the Interface course for Botox(R) and lip filler and I am extremely happy with my results. Everyone was friendly and professional, and I was given lots of time to discuss what I wanted with the the surgeon and with the doctors and dentists who were doing the course. To get so much expert input and such amazing treatment as a model patient is simply amazing. Afterwards, I was given the contact details of the team and the option of follow up if I wanted. This was really standout for me, and showed very much the friendly and caring attitude of the team on the course.  Like most people, I do get slightly nervous with needles, and I can say without reservation that I was put at ease, and made to feel very comfortable and, above all, confident with the treatment I received. Looking at the credentials of the Interface team, working in facial surgery and cosmetics, it was a big help to help me put aside any worries.",
