      "The Interface Aesthetics course was an outstanding introduction to the world of aesthetic treatment. As a practicing clinician and business owner, I needed three things from the weekend: 1) Clinical Skills, 2) Indemnity cover, 3) An in-depth knowledge of the real challenges faced by clinicians doing this day to day. Having completed the course, and as a result now practicing independently, I can confidently recommend Interface to all of those looking for a start in facial cosmetic procedures. I was delighted by the large number of real patients provided, and the expert tuition of our tutor Dr Olding to our small group of 4. The course allowed me to go at my own (rather slow) pace, in a secure and friendly environment.  Importantly, the venue itself was modern and clean, in an easy to get to central London location. Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable weekend, and I look forward to coming back for the Advanced Course!​",

      "I chose the Foundation Course in Botox and Dermal Fillers with Interface Aesthetics as I only had little previous experience in the field of aesthetics, and the course offered training that involved the basic knowledge about different products as well as hands-on experience with real models. I really enjoyed the two-day course as we were a small group of only four and so received amazing teaching from Dr James Olding. Being able to try out the theory on a live models right away made me improve my skills. After the course I felt confident enough to dive right into the field. I can highly recommend the Foundation Course with Interface Aesthetics.",

      "I recently attended the Botox and Dermal Filler course with Interface Aesthetics. Everything was very well organised and the location of the course superb. The amount of hands-on teaching and real patients was really the stand out feature of this course, and the real deciding factor for choosing it. Dr James was very clear in his instruction and the small number of other people in the group meant that nobody was ever rushed. The patient selection was great as well. Ultimately, I felt completely comfortable and confident to start doing Botox and fillers by myself immediately after the course, which is the most important thing.",

      "After quite some time of deciding whether I should do the course, I finally decided to go for it and I am so glad that I did. James quickly and clearly answered all the questions I had before starting, and I knew exactly what to expect from the day. The small group numbers really helped my learning and I had so much hands on experience that I was confident enough to do my first client just a few days after the course. I felt completely relaxed and had the opportunity to ask as many questions as I needed to during the day. Our clients got some great results and I am looking forward to my next training opportunity with Interface Aesthetics!!!",

      "Overall, the two-day Foundation Course for Botox® and Dermal Fillers was excellent. I am a Medical Doctor and prior to the course I did not have any experience in injecting Botox ® and Dermal Fillers. The course had a great balance in theory sessions and practical sessions (morning theory, afternoon practice) at a neat location. The Saturday covered Botox ® and the Sunday covered Dermal Fillers. Dr. James Olding is a great and knowledgeable teacher and I felt safe asking any questions. During the practical parts Dr. James guided me and the other delegates through the process. The practical part included plenty of hands-on for the delegates. I was lucky to have a group of only 3 delegates during the course and therefore I was very confident in my practice after the course. I really appreciated the inclusion of cheek fillers in this course. The course also included information on insurance and FAQ on how to set up your own business, which I successfully did after the course.",
