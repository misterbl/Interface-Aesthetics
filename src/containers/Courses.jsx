                Overall, the two-day Foundation Course for Botox速 and dermal
                fillers was excellent. I am a Medical Doctor and prior to the
                course I did not have any experience in injecting Botox 速 and
                dermal fillers. The course had a great balance in theory
                sessions and practical sessions (morning theory, afternoon
                practice) at a neat location. The Saturday covered Botox 速 and
                the Sunday covered dermal fillers. Dr. James Olding is a great
                and knowledgeable teacher and I felt safe asking any questions.
                During the practical parts Dr. James guided me and the other
                delegates through the process. The practical part included
                plenty of hands-on for the delegates. I was lucky to have a
                group of only 3 delegates during the course and therefore I was
                very confident in my practice after the course. I really
                appreciated the inclusion of cheek fillers in this course. The
                course also included information on insurance and FAQ on how to
                set up your own business, which I successfully did after the
                course.
