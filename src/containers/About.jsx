                Interface Aesthetics has a proven track record of getting our
                delegates into independent practice. Working with the industry
                leaders, and ensuring all training is hands-on and practically
                oriented, our delegates have the confidence to start independent
                work immediately after our courses. All teaching is firmly
                grounded in anatomy, and delivered by doctors with backgrounds
                in head & neck surgery and aesthetics.
              </p>
              <p>
                We exclusively train healthcare professionals, and as such we
                are able to provide a level of training commensurate with the
                healthcare qualifications and experience of our delegates.
                Learning in this way allows the course to move faster, ensuring
                delegates are pushed, while maintaining a supportive training
                environment. From the outset, tuition is patient-focused, with
                an emphasis on putting into action the theory behind safe and
                successful aesthetic practice.

              <p>
                Dr James Olding is a GMC-registered surgical doctor, training in
                Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery. He is a Member of The Royal
                College of Surgeons of England. He has built on his passion for
                facial surgery and aesthetics through developing non-surgical
                aesthetic training courses that meet the needs of tomorrow's
                practitioners. Dr James graduated with MBChB with honours from
                the University of Bristol Medical School in 2012, as well as
                obtaining a BSc (Honours) in Medical Law and Ethics. As part of
                ongoing training in Maxillofacial Surgery, Dr James is currently
                working towards dual qualification through studying Dentistry at
                King's College London. Dr James bases training on the two
                pillars of competent practice in healthcare; knowledge and
                skills. The formula is simple: With sufficient knowledge it is
                possible to develop practical skills, and with sufficient
                hands-on experience it is possible to develop competency in a
                skill. Building upon his extensive training in medicine, surgery
                and dentistry, Dr James places detailed knowledge of head, neck
                and facial anatomy at the heart of aesthetic training. He has
                multiple publications in the area of facial surgery, and has a
                special interest in facial trauma.
