            <p>
              Dr James Olding is a GMC-registered surgical doctor, training in
              Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery. He is a Member of The Royal College
              of Surgeons of England. He has built on his passion for facial
              surgery and aesthetics through developing non-surgical aesthetic
              training courses that meet the needs of tomorrow's practitioners.
              Dr James graduated with MBChB with honours from the University of
              Bristol Medical School in 2012, as well as obtaining a BSc
              (Honours) in Medical Law and Ethics. As part of ongoing training
              in Maxillofacial Surgery, Dr James is currently working towards
              dual qualification through studying Dentistry at King's College
              London. Dr James bases training on the two pillars of competent
              practice in healthcare; knowledge and skills. The formula is
              simple: With sufficient knowledge it is possible to develop
              practical skills, and with sufficient hands-on experience it is
              possible to develop competency in a skill. Building upon his
              extensive training in medicine, surgery and dentistry, Dr James
              places detailed knowledge of head, neck and facial anatomy at the
              heart of aesthetic training. He has multiple publications in the
              area of facial surgery, and has a special interest in facial
              trauma.

              A career in medical aesthetics can be hugely rewarding in all
              senses. It is a rapidly growing area, with continuous advances in
              techniques and technology. To be at the forefront of such an area
              is hugely exciting. Non-surgical cosmetic treatments are rapidly
              becoming the new normal, and wide and diverse demographic groups
              now seek aesthetic treatment to manage the signs of ageing and
              enhance natural features.

              Being successful in aesthetics can be extremely lucrative; all
              work is private, and your skills will be evermore in demand in
